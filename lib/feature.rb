# Feature module provides all methods
# - to set a feature repository
# - to check if a feature (represented by a symbol) is active or inactive
# - for conditional block execution with or without a feature
# - to refresh the feature lists (request them from repository)
#
# @note all features not active will be handled has inactive
#
# Example usage:
#   repository = SimpleRepository.new
#   repository.add_active_feature(:feature_name)
#
#   Feature.set_repository(repository)
#   Feature.active?(:feature_name)
#   # => true
#   Feature.inactive?(:inactive_feature)
#   # => false
#
#   Feature.with(:feature_name) do
#     # code will be executed
#   end
#
